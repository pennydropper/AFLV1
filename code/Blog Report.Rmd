## Introduction


## AFL Tipping for Beginners

Here's a quick introduction to AFL tipping for people with more diverse interests than me.

The AFL competition consists of 18 teams across Australia who each play 22 games over 23 rounds in a season that runs from mid-March to August.  In recent seasons, most teams have one bye around mid-season.  The top 8 teams after round 23 the compete in the "Finals", with a Grand Final played at the end of September or start of October.
